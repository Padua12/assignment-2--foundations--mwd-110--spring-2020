   <p>
Gabe Alesse began exploring photography early in his high school career. Living in Boston there were always new and exciting places to explore. He found a home when many of his skater friends also became interested in photography. Most of his time was spent between skating and making photographs of the streets and people of Boston.

He spent a summer working as a dishwasher in New Mexico, hiking with his friends on his off days is where he found a love for landscape and wildlife photography. His work expanded to shooting multiple different mediums, including digital, film, and instant photography. He spends most of the free time he has working to master his craft. Whether heâ€™s out on a shoot, at a party, or just going to class, he always has a camera with him for when inspiration strikes.
